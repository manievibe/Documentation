                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                        language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                        the
                        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
                        of
                        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                        extended
                        for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side <code>JavaScript</code> extends the core language by supplying objects to
                            control a
                            browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
                            application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                            clicks,
                            form
                            input, and page navigation.</li>
                        <li>Server-side By providing objects necessary for executing JavaScript on a server,
                            <code>JavaScript</code> expands the language's base syntax. For instance, server-side
                            extensions
                            enable an application to interact with a database, maintain information across application
                            calls, or
                            handle file operations on a server.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Java and JavaScript are comparable to one other in certain respects but fundamentally different
                        in
                        others. Although JavaScript is similar to Java, it lacks Java's static typing and robust type
                        checking.
                        LiveScript was renamed to JavaScript because it largely adheres to Java expression syntax,
                        naming
                        standards, and fundamental control-flow features.</p>
                    <p><section class="spantext">JavaScript offers a runtime system based on a limited number of data types that represent
                        numeric,
                        Boolean, and textual values, in contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes defined via
                        declarations. Instead of the more typical class-based object model, JavaScript uses a
                        prototype-based
                        object model.</section>
                        <p>The prototype-based model offers dynamic inheritance, which allows individual
                        objects'
                        inheritance to change. Functions without any unique declarative requirements are likewise
                        supported
                        by
                        JavaScript. Functions can operate as weakly typed methods and be properties of other objects.</p>

                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page
                        creation.
                        It
                        allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the
                        building
                        blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

                        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page
                            elements,
                            such
                            as text, hyperlinks, and media files.</li>
                        <li>Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and
                            websites
                            as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. </li>
                        <li>Web documentation. <code>HTML</code> makes it possible to organize and format documents,
                            similarly
                            to Microsoft Word.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section">

                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to
                        simplify
                        the
                        process of making web pages presentable.

                        CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer
                        specially
                        when
                        they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
                        learning
                        CSS:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Faster Page Speed</li>
                        <li>Better user experience</li>
                        <li>Quicker development time</li>
                        <li>Easy formatting changes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><code>p  {  font-size:20px;  color:red;  }</code> will make the color of the text red and set the
                        font-size to 20px</p>

                </section>
                <section class="main-section">
                    <header id="hello-world">Hello world</header>
                    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                        JavaScript
                        code</p>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section">
                    <header id="variables">Variables</header>
                    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                        called
                        identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                        characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                        characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</br>

                        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                        Unicode
                        escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                        temp99,
                        and
                        _name.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section">
                    <header id="Conditions">Conditions</header>
                    <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                        clause
                        to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</br>
                        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                    <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation
                        of
                        what
                        evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further
                        nested
                        if
                        statements.</br>
                        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in
                        sequence,
                        as
                        follows:<br><code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; }</br>else if (condition_2) {
statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
statement_last; }</code></p>
